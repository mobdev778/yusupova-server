The Tsvetaev Prize is not Yusupova's first poetry award: in 2003, Lilia became a laureate of the Shukshin Prize, in 2011 she received a diploma from an international competition for translations of Turkic-language poetry, in 2012 - a diploma from an international competition of contemporary drama.",
